    If enabled, when an event is received from TFS/Team Services for a Git repository, all the Jenkins jobs that use that Git repository will be automatically triggered, even if they didn't enable the "Build when a change is pushed to TFS/Team Services" trigger.<br />
    <br />
    Individual jobs can opt-out of this global opt-in by enabling the <b>Poll SCM</b> trigger and checking its <b>Ignore post-commit hooks</b> checkbox.
