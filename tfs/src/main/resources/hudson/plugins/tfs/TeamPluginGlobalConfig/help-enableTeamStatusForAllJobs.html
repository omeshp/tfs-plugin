    If enabled, when an event is received from TFS/Team Services for a Git repository, all the Jenkins jobs that use that Git repository will post their status to the associated pull request and/or commit in TFS/Team Services, even if they didn't add the "Set build pending status in TFS/Team Services" build step nor the "Set build completion status in TFS/Team Services" post-build action.
